## 🦢 The Problem: ROAS is Deceptive
Traditional Google Ads management focuses on **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**. However, high-ROAS campaigns can often be unprofitable when accounting for variable margins, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), and fulfillment overhead. 

**ProfitGuard AI** is a "Profit-Aware" dashboard designed to solve the ROAS vs. Profit mismatch across all major ad platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok).

## 🛠️ How ProfitGuard Works
1. **Define Economics**: Set your product COGS (%) using the **Business Economics** panel.
2. **Connect/Import**: Link via API or upload a CSV report from **Google, Meta, or TikTok**.
3. **Analyze**: Access the **Action Plan** for a prioritized audit of your account health.
4. **Distribute**: Use the **Copy Report** feature to share formatted findings instantly.
5. **Protect**: Enable **Safety Guards** to auto-pause ads that breach your profit floor.
