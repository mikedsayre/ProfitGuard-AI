## 🦢 The Problem: ROAS is Deceptive

Traditional Google Ads management focuses on **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**. However, high-ROAS campaigns can often be unprofitable when accounting for variable margins, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), and fulfillment overhead.

**ProfitGuard AI** is a "Profit-Aware" dashboard designed to solve the ROAS vs. Profit mismatch across all major ad platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok).

## 🛠️ How ProfitGuard Works

1.  **Define Economics:** Set your product COGS (%) using the **Business Economics** panel. The app instantly recalculates "Real Profit" for every campaign.
2.  **Universal Import:** Upload a CSV report from **Google, Meta, or TikTok**. Our smart parser auto-detects columns like "Amount Spent" and "Conversion Value."
3.  **Analyze:** The **Action Plan** engine audits your data to find:
    * **"Bleeders":** Campaigns with negative margins despite high revenue.
    * **"Scalers":** High-profit opportunities ready for budget increases.
    * **"Platform Shifts":** Opportunities to move budget from expensive Search to cheaper Social channels.
4.  **Distribute:** Use the **Copy Report** feature to generate a formatted text audit instantly—ready for Slack, Email, or CRM updates.
5.  **Protect:** Visualize "Safety Guards" that would auto-pause ads breaching your profit floor.
